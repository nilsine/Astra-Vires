These are all known bugs, as reported by players (or myself) on the purely bug tracker.
Maybe someone should fix them. :)



Title 	 Non-existant ships
Status 	Outstanding
Type 	Minor
Game Afflicted 	advanced
Reported By 	FrothingWombat
Reported On 	Jun 04 2004 - 20:10
Description 	In system 59, the summary of other ships shows:
"Commando1701(1C1) has 1 Ship(s) w/ 100 Fighters - Attack"
But I click 'attack' and it says:
"You don't have a target ship/fleet selected."
And the full list of other ships says the system is empty.

Also, in 17, the summary shows:
"Reaper(1C1) has 1 Ship(s) w/ 3912 Fighters
Reaper(1C1) has 1 Ship(s) w/ 50 Fighters"
But the full list shows:
"Reaper(1C1) Violator (Attack Battleship w/ 3912 fighters)"

Yet another such situation in Sol; the summary says:
"jalweber has 1 Ship(s) w/ 100 Fighters
Admin - Pepsi has 56 Ship(s) w/ 6580500 Fighters"
In the full list, Pepsi's ships show up, but not jalweber's.

 Title 	 Safe Turns
Status 	Outstanding
Type 	Minor
Game Afflicted 	Advanced
Reported By 	ice weasel
Reported On 	Jun 07 2004 - 10:54
Description 	I tried to attack someone and i got "There are no ships in that fleet that you may attack.
Either because the ships have moved, or because that player is still in safe turns." The admin set the turns before being able to be attacked to 0, so i would asume there is a bug.

UPDATE - Moriarty - - Jun 07 - 14:28
Are you sure it's not simply because the ships moved?

UPDATE - ice weasel - - Jun 07 - 15:23
The ships were still there after i tried, and i was the only active user then.

UPDATE - ice weasel - - Jun 14 - 22:55
might as well close this mori, the round is long over, so nothing more can be said.

 Title 	 Cannot attack ships
Status 	Outstanding
Type 	Minor
Game Afflicted 	Slow Newbie (SD)
Reported By 	CrymsonKyng
Reported On 	Jun 27 2004 - 07:38
Description 	It's SD in the slow game but I get the following msg. when trying to attack ships.

You don't have a target ship/fleet selected.

(I got this when trying to attack a couple ships at Sol.)

UPDATE - CrymsonKyng - - Jun 27 - 09:13
I'm only guessing, but the following variable may be stopping attacks at Sol during this SD.

keep_sol_clear
Choose if all non-newbie ships are to be cattered from Sol if they are in that system for two consecutive hourly maints.
checked Ships accumulate in Sol
Ships scattered and players frustrated :)


UPDATE - FrothingWombat - - Jun 30 - 10:32
This looks to be the same as the 'non-existant ships' bug I reported a while back. It's happening in Blitz too, and it doesn't happen just in sol, or just in SD.

UPDATE - ryloran - - Jul 13 - 12:05
You don't have a target ship/fleet selected
did the same thing to me in advanced- please change this to a higher priority. It could seriously effect the game if it gets any worse.

No idea what is causing it.

 Title 	 Self destructing
Status 	Outstanding
Type 	Minor
Game Afflicted 	Blitz
Reported By 	warble
Reported On 	Sep 15 2004 - 23:00

i won an adv. transverser in bilko's so i sd'd my two transversers (i had two cos i was gonna give one to the trapped player but he already got one from someone else) while commanding one of them and the one i was commanding still existed and took up fleet space afterward

UPDATE - Moriarty - - Sep 16 - 09:02
u shouldn't be able to destroy the ship you are commanding.

 Title 	 fleet change
Status 	Outstanding
Type 	Minor
Game Afflicted 	blitz
Reported By 	sanchez sucio
Reported On 	Sep 19 2004 - 13:06
Description 	ive reprted this before, but i didn't fully explain it, i think....
when you have x ships of one type.. (e.g. merchant freighter) and change one to be your commmand ship, they are all the same fleet.
then when you change the non-commanding merchant freighters to a different fleet, it also changes your commanding MF to fleet 2.
At first they will be separate fleets, but if you try to move your command ship ONLY to another system, it will become part of fleet #2.

 Title 	 mining
Status 	Outstanding
Type 	Trivial
Game Afflicted 	slow
Reported By 	sanchez sucio
Reported On 	Jun 05 2004 - 19:58
Description 	MF 03
Merchant Freighter
Fleet: 1
Fighters: 50 / 300
Shields: 150 / 150
Armour: 20 / 20
Specials: fr
Cargo Bays:
     7 Fuels

i know the mining rate is not what it used to be, but im mining fuels, so it should be 5 per hour.. and well... 7 doesnt seem to be a number you should get... I have been mining for 2 hours since my last sale of cargo, and i had 5 fuels 2 hours ago, so that means i only mined 2 this hour...

UPDATE - sanchez sucio - - Jun 05 - 19:59
this can't be an invalid.. cuz.. well... it actually happened...

UPDATE - Moriarty - - Jun 06 - 02:44
Hmm. the mining rate for fuel for that ship is:
mine_rate_fuel - 5
and 1 for metal.

Have you swiched the mining ability SINCE you reported the bug, and before i posted this update?

Mind at present that ship has 19 in it. - i'm guessing u didn't unload it from 7. so that means it's gained 12 fuels sincec 3 maints (since 19:58 when u posted)
noting that they should get a minimum of 4 and a max of 6 when it's set to 5, we can conclude that it is working, because 4 times 3 is twelve.
But i'll keep it on my list of things to do.

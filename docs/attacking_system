ship size






Attacking fighters do 35% less than their total.
Defending fighters do 15% less than their total.
Fighter damages can modify by +/- 6% randomly.

ships size is then divided by 100.
8 (largest) = 8% increase in damage taken
4 (normal) = 4% increase in damage taken
1 (smallest) = 1% increase in damage taken

Ship speed is divided by 100.
7 (largest) = 7% increase in damage dealt, decrease in damage taken
4 (normal) = 4% increase in damage dealt, decrease in damage taken
1 (smallest) = 1% increase in damage dealt, decrease in damage taken

points killed goes up by 1, then divided by 100. max = 20% increase.
Goes towards damage dealt.

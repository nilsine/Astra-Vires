<title>The Solar Empire Story</title>

[!--[h3]"One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."[/h3]--]In the year 2092, one hundred and twenty five years after man's momentus Apollo 11 mission to the moon, the four-member crew of the Starship Excelsior became the first the first humans to travel to another star system. The celebrations and excitement on Earth were intense, to say the least. Wild parties were thrown which taxed the resources of police departments around the world, the media was caught up in a frenzied coverage of the event, politicians praised their own efforts and Jonathon Browning, a nondescript technician at the sprawling SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute in Arizona received the first communication from an alien species.
[p /]The United Nations was aghast at the message. Humanity shared a collective sense of rage and indignation. Far from the over-popularised demand of "Take me to your leader", the message was a polite but obviously threatening warning, advising mankind never to leave the Solar System again or risk war with a technologically advanced alien species. After months of heated debate and political manoeuvring, the reply was broadcast into deep space, a challenging request that the aliens mind their own business and steer clear of humanity's expansion into the galaxy. [p /]The response of the aliens was swift and horribly brutal. A fleet of streamlined starships entered Earth's orbit a few weeks later and without provocation or a hint of warning, proceeded to pound into rubble the proud capital cities of the world powers. The resulting chaos plunged Earth into a new Dark Age.
[p /]Economies stalled and crashed, countries descended into mayhem and war, famine was widespread and the situation was exacerbated by the accidental launch of a handful of nuclear missiles from various locations around the globe. Fighting against war, famine, long-forgotten diseases, radioactive hotspots and economic ruin, it took almost ten years for a new order to emerge, one ruled by the iron-fisted influence of the new age Corporations. 
[p /]Gradually order returned to the world under the control of the Corporations. But a fatal shortage of food and raw resources was the only stumbling block to their domination of the planet. Research into space travel was resurrected. In the New Age economies, private companies and entrepreneurs invested funds into the research and slowly a gradual process of integration and alliances gave birth to the first Clans, great organisations that encompassed Corporations, their allies and entire populations. The dawning of the first Warp Engine Drive, combining old Ion Propulsion Engines with experimental Wormhole technology, acted as a catalyst to speed up the development of spaceships capable of instantaneous interstellar travel.
[p /]Earth's orbit became cluttered with dozens of orbiting Manufacturing Stations churning out advanced spacecraft to serve the needs of the Clans. Freighters, Battleships, Harvester ships for mining, Colony ships and single-pilot Fighters were built as well as a host of other exotic starships. Rivalry and competition resulted in spates of sabotage and industrial espionage as the Clans fought for supremacy of the new technologies that were being developed day by day.
[p /]In 2123, the first interstellar starships left the Sol system and expanded the reach of the Clans to other star systems. These early exploratory missions were to act as the platform from which to launch an all out assault on the galaxy. Star Systems were mapped and explored for signs of fuel or metals, whether from meteorites or planets. Aliens were encountered but humanity's fleets of advanced spacecraft were able to repel many of the attacks. The alien species were many. New alliances and peace treaties were signed but the aggressiveness and savagery of other extraterrestrial species led to many attacks and raids.
[p /]As mankind continued the expansion, rivalry and competition took a further step and fuelled wars and arguments between the Clans. Soon all out war was to ready erupt, Clans allied themselves with others and in time not even the Sol System was safe from attacks and raids by rival Clan members. [p /]The year is now 2126. The Clans and individuals have agreed that this will be the year that humanity will at long last colonise the galaxy. A new age has dawned for mankind, an age of interstellar travel, Clan wars, extraterrestrial races and alien raids, an age of colonisation and exploration, an age of Solar Empires.

<title>Delta Bomb Blueprints Disappear</title>
<author>Moriarty</author>
<date>27-Jan-2002</date>
<content>
In breaking news today we have learnt of a new threat to the (in)stability of the galaxy. The Corporation known as [b class=b1]Heavy Weapons Inc.[/b] has reported the theft of a set of blueprints for a new bomb they have been developing.
[p /]Investigators believe the theft was conducted by a small militia group called [b class=b1]Liberation for Sol[/b] for a third party, however they have no idea who the third party is at present. They fear that the new owners of the blueprints will use them to build the bombs, and then sell them via Bilkos to the highest bidder.
[p /]The Bomb - which has the production name [b class=b1]Delta[/b] - was developed for the military, with the specific purpose of being used to target large warfleets. Though Heavy Weapons Inc. refuse to discuss the capabilites of the bomb, they have released a statement saying it "has the potential to cause major damage if it gets into the wrong hands."

<title>New Ships Spotted at Blackmarkets</title>
<author>Moriarty</author>
<date>5-June-2002</date>
<content>
Those insidous hives of roguery and brigandage are now also home to two new ship designs.[br /]At least thats what un-confirmed reports from undercover officers who have infiltrated the pirate networks say. The reports, though patchy, allow an impression of the ships capabilities and purposes to be given.[br /][br /]The first goes by the production-name [b class=b1]Occultator[/b], and is reported to be the shell of an asteroid which has been filled with fighter bays. The reports neglect to state the purpose the ship was designed for, however from what has been uncovered, it seems likely the ship - if it can be called that - would be ideal for eliminating planets. The name given to the ship (Occultation meaning [b]The process of an asteroid blocking star-light from going to the planet below[/b]) only strengthens this theory.
[p /]The second ship is simply classed as a [b class=b1]Gunboat[/b]. All that is known of this ship is that it is small, fast, and outfitted with enough alien technology as to allow it to be a significant threat to merchant shipping.
[p /]We only hope that by spreading the contents of these reports we are making fleet captains and planetary governors everywhere more aware of the new dangers that pervade the galaxy.

<title>Seatogus announces ship improvements</title>
<author>Moriarty</author>
<date>5-June-2002</date>
<content>
In related news, [b class=b1]Seatogu's Spacecraft Emporium[/b] have made two important announcements today. The first of which stated they were to improve many existing ship designs by adding the recently developed turrets to them.[p /]A spokesman for the company said that "In this increasingly hostile galaxy, we want our customers to be able to feel safe. It is at their request that we have made these improvements, and we only hope that it serves to improve their life expectancy".

[p /]In a second, later announcement, Seatogu's proclaimed that all new ships will be outfitted with an improved battle AI (Artificial Intelligence).[br /]This AI will allow ships to better utilise the numerous offensive and defensive upgrades that are available to ship captains these days. [br /]Seatogu's press report says "With the advent of this new AI we believe that pirates and brigands alike will have to be more wary as to what they attack". The statement goes on to say "This new AI will also allow captains to set their battleships to defend the rest of their fleet, as it features advanced [b]threat prediction algorithms[/b] that enable battleships to spot incoming hostiles before they get to the fleet".

[p /]One industry critic made the astute observation that blackmarkets had somehow aquired this new AI software and were proceeding to install it on all their ships. She followed this through with a obvious, but controvesial point "Blackmarket ships would be severly outmatched without this new software, and as such ship losses would be much lower on the side of Seatogu's customers".
[br /]The implication is clear. Seatogu's were unavailable for comment this evening.

[p /]It should be noted that despite these improvements, the price of the ships will remain the same.

<title>Engine Upgrades Released</title>
<author>Moriarty</author>
<date>17-Febuary-2003</date>
<content>
With the advent of ever larger ships and the increasing number of skirmishes that have been taking place in the frontier systems, it should come as no surprise to space exploration followers that improved engines are a must.

[p /]In an under-cover operation into the heart of one of the most notorious blackmarket rings in the galaxy, this reporter discovered that blackmarket operators have had access to such engines for some time.
[br /]Indeed it would seem that the reports of ships going faster than their design specs are true, and that this technology was sold to a select few clients (read: Pirates) netting the operaters large sums of money.

[p /]But all that has changed now as the blackmarket rings release the [b class=b1]Advanced Engine Upgrade[/b] to the general galactic public.[br /]According to one blackmarket operater, who wishes to remain anonymous, these upgrades can "make ya ship goo faster 'n a burnin' Witamink that's jus bin fired outta a Plasma Cann'n". Or to put it more technically, this upgrade will allow for more maneuverability in combat, and - under the right circumstances - even lower travel times between star systems. [br /]When asked why this upgrade was being released now, the blackmarket operator somewhat cryptically replied "'cos we dunt need 'um no more".

[p /]Coming just a suspiciously close couple of days after the blackmarket release, Sol's Upgrade store - run by the sometimes controversial Vladimir - has released it's own Engine Upgrade too.
[br /]According to Vladimir, "Upon hearing of the release of these illegel upgrades, we decided to rush our own Engine Improvements onto the market early so as to give people a legitimate alternative to what would otherwise be a bad investment.". In response to the rumours that the legitimate version is actually less capable than it's illegal counterpart, Vladimir had this to say: "After conducting a serious of tests on one of the illegal upgrades we seized, it is clear that their offering does offer double the performance that ours do. However, I should add that not all the technology used in their Upgrades is fully understood, so it would be better for anyone considering investing in such a product to stick with our tried and tested version"

[p /]The blackmarket operators reponse to those same rumours was un-surprisingly rather different: "Those darn authorities jus keep 'olding back technology from the cus'mer. If the cus'mer wants' uh decent Engine Upgrade, they cun git 'em 'ere. Un if they're stupid nuff to buy the rubbish offered at Sol, it's their ohn pro-lem."

[p /]That said, we leave it to you, the customer, to decide which is the better.

<title>Shipyard Wars Heat-Up</title>
<author>Moriarty</author>
<date>24-March-2003</date>
<content>
9 Months ago we reported on the release of the [b class=b1]Occultator[/b] into the universe by the Blackmarket operators.
[br /]Today we are reporting that the Shipyards at Sol have begun manufacturing those very same ships, albeit with some minor modifications.

[p /]According to official reports, the story into how Authorities gained the plans goes as follows:[blockquote]
[br /]We [The Sol Authorities] first gained an insight into it, close-up, after a rather foolish captain brought his Occultator to Sol, with the hope of getting it duplicated. Needless to say the ship was immediately impounded, and the captain in question shipped straight off to a prison world, to enjoy the hospitality of the tax payers.
[br /]From this seizure we were able to get an idea as to the Occultators abilities, and then decided that it would be in the best interests of space pioneers, that some regulations be imposed on them.

[p /]We quickly organised and then proceeded to execute a number of raids against black-markets, until a copy of the plans for the Occultator were found.
[br /]These plans are now in the hands of Sol's shipyard opperators who have been adapting them to meet the new guidelines we have set.
[br /]The new guidelines basically pertain to classing the Occultator as a [b class=b1]warship[/b] which means a different ship limit will be imposed on them.
[/blockquote]


[p /][br /]In response to this new ability for Sol's shipyards to build the Occultator, the Blackmarket operator we spoke to about these events said they have stopped selling by claiming "'twas old hat. We've got newer better stuff now.".
[br /]This is not just idle banter either.
[br /]We can now confirm for the first time, the rumours that a new ship is available from the Blackmarkets. This new ship is sold under the name [b class=b1]Behemoth[/b], a name which, we might add, is well suited to it.

[p /]The Behemoth is certainly large, outsizing any other battleship that's available, and is equiped with both legal Sol registered technologies, as well as the more outlandish equipment that the Blackmarkets are best known for.
[br /]The most interesting feature about this new ship is that it was designed from the bottom-up solely for space-based combat, the desginers having the idea that the (now debunkt - by their standards) Occultator was to deal with planets.
[br /]This design theory certainly contradicts any and all space combat principles that have to-date been developed, instead following the lines that each individual warship within a fleet should have a specific purpose at which it excels, rather than the common lines of thought that result in warships being all good round fighters.
[br /]Though Sol authorities condemn this mode of thought as outdated, it is with the buyers of these ships that the final decision lies.
[br /]This reporter only wonders at how many of them are broad-minded enough to be able to appreciate this new diversity.
